![Repo map](./repo_outline.svg)

An idea for a network/protocol improvement should remain in ideas (incomplete)
until fleshed out and ready for community decision on whether to proceed.
Once this point is reached, it is moved to 'Under discussion' until a community
decision is made on outcome based on discussions as linked.
