# Reduce emissions rate of the network
## Abstract
This proposal shall encourage growth and security of the network by allocating foundation resources to procuring mining power until the release of enqlave.  

## Motivation
The motivation of this proposal is to avoid the negative perception caused by the proposed emissions cut of QIP015, while simultaniously helping to grow the community and network through direct participation. This will also have the impact of removing mining and dump bots from the network, and securing a higher coin market cap rating to attract new participants, and enabling smaller miners to have an oppertunity to secure a volume that may allow them to participate in Proof-of-Stake.

## Specification
The foundation shall allocate the resources necessary to acquire 10MH of randomX mining power at market price. The results of this mining shall be distributed to the mining community under the following conditions:
Each miner must register a new wallet at the start of this event. This wallet may only receive mining output, validated by blockchain analysis. 
After the first 90 days, the foundation will distribute 30% of the total funds in the wallet at that point in time to those miners, based on adding up the total number of coins across all wallets proportionately.
After 180 days from the start of the event, the foundation will do the same with 50% of the total funds in the wallet at that point in time, using the same system to determine distribution.
At the one year mark, or the release of proof of stake, 90% of the total funds in the wallet at that point in time, using the same system to determine distribution.
Should a new participant wish to register at any point after the official launch, they shall only be able to participate in the final distribution should they have held funds for 180 days prior to the distribution date.

## Backward compatibility
N/A

## Implementation
Implementation requires the creation of a system to track wallets, validate mining balances and the procurement of mining power.
