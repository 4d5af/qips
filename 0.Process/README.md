# Introduction

Following mainnet-launch, any significant design changes must pass through a QIP
process, prior to being implemented in release code. We are a friendly bunch and
likely to approve useful and innovative suggestions.

## Process

### [1. Ideas](../1.Ideas)

QIPs start as ideas: itâ€™s a good idea to share these ideas with the development
and wider QRL community.  These incomplete proposals live in the [1. Ideas/1. Incomplete](../1.Ideas/1.Incomplete)
folder within this repository, and comments on the parent parent pull request
should allow refinement of the idea before it becomes a formal proposal.

Ideas that are abandoned are archived in the
[1. Ideas/2. Abandoned](../1.Ideas/2.Abandoned) subfolder

### [2. Proposals](../2.Proposals)

#### [2.1 Open proposals](../2.Proposals/1.Open)

The first stage of a formal proposal is submission of a new open proposal.
Public comment is invited on open proposals in a similar manner to ideas.  Once
the proposal is sufficiently mature it will be moved by the QRL Foundation
maintainers to the next stage.

#### [2.2 Under discussion](../2.Proposals/2.Under_discussion)

Proposals under discussion will be considered at the next QRL Developer meeting.
Particularly complex or in depth QIPs may require a separate meeting or
face-to-face discussions by the QRL development team prior to decisions being
made as to the outcome.  As this point they may be returned to 2.1 for further refinement.

#### [2.3a. Accepted](../2.Proposals/3a.Accepted)

Accepted proposals require development until such a point when they are released
or they are ready for release at the next hard fork of the network.  As such, an
accepted QIP may be in one of four states:

1. Available (for a developer/team to take on engineering the QIP; avoiding
duplication of effort)

2. In development

3. Awaiting hard fork

4. Completed

#### [2.3b. Deferred](../2.Proposals/3b.Deferred)

Deferred proposals have merit to the project but for operational reasons are held
back from entering development.  Deferred proposals may enter development at a
later date or may move into a different category as the network matures.

#### [2.3c. Rejected](../2.Proposals/3c.Rejected)

Rejected proposals will not enter development without commencing the QIP process
from the beginning and re-working the proposal.

## How to submit

### Document format

In general, documents should be formatted using the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) syntax. There a [plenty](https://www.ossblog.org/markdown-editors/) of very good Markdown editors available.

### Submission

To submit, clone this Github repository, add a sequentially named folder to either
the _1. Ideas_ or _2. Proposals / 1. Open_ folder and place a `README.md`
Markdown document within the newly created folder.  Include any linked images in
the folder then submit a pull request.

Comments on your QIP should be initiated on the pull request.

### Template

A template QIP document is in this folder titled [TEMPLATE_qip-000.md](./TEMPLATE_qip-000.md)
